# ML-Workflow-For-Scones-Unlimited

## Project overview
In this project, youâ€™ll use AWS Sagemaker to build an image classification model that can tell bicycles apart from motorcycles. You'll deploy your model, use AWS Lambda functions to build supporting services, and AWS Step Functions to compose your model and services into an event-driven application.

## Background
Image Classifiers are used in the field of computer vision to identify the content of an image and it is used across a broad variety of industries, from advanced technologies like autonomous vehicles and augmented reality, to eCommerce platforms, and even in diagnostic medicine.

## Objective
building an image classification model that can automatically detect which kind of vehicle delivery drivers have, in order to route them to the correct loading bay and orders and ship a scalable and safe model.

## Project Steps Overview
1. Data staging
2. Model training and deployment
3. Lambdas and step function workflow
4. Testing and evaluation
